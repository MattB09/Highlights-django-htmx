Highlight (Yellow),Location 62,,I would have lived in peace. But my enemies brought me war.
Highlight (Yellow),Location 73,,I was forged in the bowels of this hard world. Sharpened by hate. Strengthened by love.
Highlight (Yellow),Page 6,,"Patience and obedience, young one. Patience is the better part of valor. And obedience the better part of humanity."
Highlight (Yellow),Page 33,,"“Speak and they will listen,” she urges. “It is that bloody simple. All ears yearn for a voice to lead them through darkness.”"
Highlight (Yellow),Page 34,,"“Death isn’t empty like you say it is. Emptiness is life without freedom, Darrow. Emptiness is living chained by fear, fear of loss, of death. I say we break those chains."
Highlight (Yellow),Page 42,,"My love, my love Remember the cries When winter died for spring skies They roared and roared But we grabbed our seed And sowed a song Against their greed And Down in the vale Hear the reaper swing, the reaper swing the reaper swing Down in the vale Hear the reaper sing A tale of winter done My son, my son Remember the chains When gold ruled with iron reins We roared and roared And twisted and screamed For ours, a vale of better dreams"
Highlight (Yellow),Page 45,,"On Mars there is not much gravity, so you have to pull the feet to break the neck. They let the loved ones do it."
Highlight (Yellow),Page 63,,"“Do you know why we call ourselves Sons of Ares, Darrow? To the Romans, Mars was the god of war—a god of military glory, defense of the hearth and home. Honorable and all. But Mars is a fraud. He is a romanticized version of the Greek god Ares.”"
Highlight (Yellow),Page 63,,"“Ares was a bastard, an evil patron of rage, violence, bloodlust, and massacre,”"
Highlight (Yellow),Page 70,,"“Five hundred years.” I shake my head. “This is our bloodydamn planet.” “Through sweat and toil it was made so,” he agrees. “Then what will it take to take it back?” “Blood.” Dancer smiles at me like a township alleycat. There’s a beast behind this man’s fatherly smiles. Eo was right. It comes to violence."
Highlight (Yellow),Page 71,,"Even that Gamma had a family. He dug like me. He was born like me, went through the flush like me, and he never saw the sun either. He was just given a little packet of medicine by the Society, and look at the effect. How clever of them. How much hate they create between people who should be kin."
Highlight (Yellow),Page 72,,An empire cannot be destroyed from without till it is destroyed from within.
Highlight (Yellow),Page 72,,"The Gray soldiers prowl the cities ensuring order, ensuring obedience to the hierarchy. The Whites arbitrate their justice and push their philosophy. Pinks pleasure and serve in highColor homes. Silvers count and manipulate currency and logistics. Yellows study the medicines and sciences. Greens develop technology. Blues navigate the stars. Coppers run the bureaucracy. Every Color has a purpose. Every Color props up the Golds."
Highlight (Yellow),Page 76,,"“In the densest places of man, humanity most easily breaks down,”"
Highlight (Yellow),Page 81,,"A Bronze is a faded Gold. Of the same class, but looked down on for inferior appearance, lineage, and capabilities."
Highlight (Yellow),Page 87,,would you have been happier if you knew you were a slave?” Mickey asks. “No. None of the billion lowReds beneath Mars would be happy if they knew what the highReds knew—that they are slaves. So is it not better to lie?” “It is better to not make slaves.”
Highlight (Yellow),Page 91,,is the hottest fire that forms the sternest steel.

Highlight (Yellow),Page 105,,Polemides is Greek for “child of war.”
Highlight (Yellow),Page 121,,"“Society has three stages: Savagery, Ascendance, Decadence. The great rise because of Savagery. They rule in Ascendance. They fall because of their own Decadence.”"
